Abstract
========

The DRE of the current version of CYCLUS handles the cost of materials being traded in a 
way which was always intended to be expanded upon as discussed in the Supply-Demand 
Framework section of CEP 18. This CEP references moving the Supply-Demand from being 
requester based to being supplier based, with more considerations for economics. As a part 
of moving the DRE in that direction, it is necessary to add economic-based elements to  
the definitions of the Region, Institution, and Facility in such a way as to allow them 
to interact with each other economically. The proposal for doing so is to add sub-classes 
to each which will act as a method of communicating economic information between layers 
of the simulation.

Copyright:
==============================

CEP 30 will be placed in the public domain as required by CEP 1.

Specification:
============================

The new feature being proposed is a subclass for each of the Region, Institution, and 
Facility classes which will allow the communication of economic data between each layer 
of the CYCLUS simulation. The main feature of the subclass will be a hash table 
(enabled by std::unordered_map) which contains pairs of keys (std::string) and values 
(doubles), as well as functions to set and get elements in the table. 

Motivation:
==================

The major motivation for this new feature is that currently when a Facility tries to access 
information about its Institution, it can only reliably use the public API of the Institution 
base class. That is, it is dangerous to try to access something that is only in the public 
API of a derived Institution archetype because it may not always be there. Because of the 
interdependence of imagined economic functionality on the Facility-Institution-Region 
relationship (a facility’s cost may be impacted by its own capital cost, as well as its 
parent institution’s minimum acceptable rate of return and the regional tax rate, for 
instance), the ability of a facility to access information about its parent Agents is 
crucial.

Rationale:
===========================

It was decided to make the overall feature a subclass is to keep it in line with the class-subclass 
structure of other CYCLUS functionality, such as the Facility Institution Region - Agent structure. 
The reasons for choosing a hash table over another data structure are that they allow quick and 
easy expansion both by developers and within the simulation itself, as well as search, insert, and 
delete operations being ostensibly O(1). 

During the public vetting stage of CEP 30’s lifecycle two alternative ideas for implementing this 
behavior were proposed. The first was to use the code injection functionality of cycpp files to 
add economic information to archetypes themselves at the beginning of simulations. This was tested, 
but it was discovered that there were problems accessing the information of parent agents, and it 
was determined that this approach would be some combination of too cumbersome and less certain to 
work. The second idea was to implement some sort of registry, similar to how Microsoft Windows 
(and other operating systems) handle some of their internal operations, but this was deemed to be 
too much of a bloat hazard, as registries can become very complicated very quickly.

Backwards Compatibility:
===========================

Since this feature is proposed as a subclass of each of the three agent subclasses, it will be 
optional to use, and therefore entirely possible to completely ignore it. This means it should 
require no work to ensure backwards compatibility with older versions of CYCLUS.
